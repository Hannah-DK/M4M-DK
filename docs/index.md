On this site you find the workshop material for the danish Metadata for Machines (short: M4M) workshop!

The aim of the M4M WS is to make a research groupâ€™s data meet the most basic principles of [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) by improving your metadata and making it machine actionable. This approach will increase the impact of the research groups data, making the data discoverable and citable, and in the process also promote good data handling practices internally, and ease collaboration with external parties by easing data exchange/integrations.

The workshop is organized by [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/) in collaboration with [GO-FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/).

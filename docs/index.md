On this site you find the workshop material for the danish Metadata for Machines (short: M4M) workshop!

The aim of the M4M WS is to work practically on how to improve your metadata and make them machine-actionable, thus complying with the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles. By doing this you will increase the impact of the research group's data, making the data discoverable and citable, while learning good data handling practices, which strengthens your data handling internally as well as within your peer group.

The workshop is offered by [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/) in collaboration with [GO-FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/).

If you have any questions, you are welcome to write to Hannah.Mihai@deic.dk
